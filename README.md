# üéì My University Python Projects

This repository contains Python projects and exercises completed during my university coursework. It serves as both a learning portfolio and a way to track my progress in software development.

*Please note: These exercises were developed as part of my university studies in Poland, so the original comments, instructions, and some variable names are in Polish.*

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Intro to dicts and lists
* **File:** `intro_to_lists_and_dicts.ipynb`
* **Description:** This Jupyter Notebook contains my initial exercises exploring the fundamentals of Python. It's a hands-on introduction to core programming concepts.

#### Topics Covered:
* **Variables & Data Structures:** Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples.
* **Control Flow:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

### 2. Functions in Python
* **File:** `functions.ipynb`
* **Description:** This notebook focuses on defining and using functions in Python, a core concept for writing clean and efficient code.

#### Topics Covered:
* **Function Basics:** Defining and calling functions.
* **Parameters:** Passing arguments, using default values, and keyword arguments.
* **Return Values:** Using the `return` statement to send data back from a function.

### 3. Control Flow Statements
* **File:** `control_flow.ipynb`
* **Description:** An in-depth exercise on control flow, covering conditional logic and loops to manage the execution path of a program.

#### Topics Covered:
* **Conditional Logic:** Advanced use of `if/else` statements.
* **Loops:** Iterating with `for` loops over different data types and using `while` loops for conditional execution.
* **Loop Control:** Using `break` to exit a loop.
