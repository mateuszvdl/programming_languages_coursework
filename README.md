# 🎓 My University Python Projects

This repository contains Python projects and exercises completed during my university coursework. It serves as both a learning portfolio and a way to track my progress in software development.

*Please note: These exercises were developed as part of my university studies in Poland, so the original comments, instructions, and some variable names are in Polish.*
